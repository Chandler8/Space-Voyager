We choose to explore space because doing so improves our lives, and lifts our national spirit. So let us continue the journey.– George W. Bush'", "'The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join in it or not, and it is one of the great adventures of all time, and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in the race for space.– John F. Kennedy'", "'“I know the sky is not the limit because there are footprints on the Moon — and I made some of them!– Buzz Aldrin'", "'Earth is a small town with many neighborhoods in a very big universe.– Ron Garan'", "'What everyone in the astronaut corps shares in common is not gender or ethnic background, but motivation, perseverance, and desire — the desire to participate in a voyage of discovery.– Ellen Ochoa'", "'Of course risk is part of spaceflight. We accept some of that to achieve greater goals in exploration and find out more about ourselves and the universe.– Lisa Nowak'", "'One of the basic rules of the universe is that nothing is perfect. Perfection simply doesn’t exist…..Without imperfection, neither you nor I would exist.– Stephen Hawking'", "'For every one billion particles of antimatter there were one billion and one particles of matter. And when the mutual annihilation was complete, one billionth remained – and that’s our present universe.– Albert Einstein'"],

{{!-- Notes for work in progress --}}
{{!-- Footer doesn't want to move down to the bottom, need to send me the particles.js files so we can incorporate that, looks great! --}}
